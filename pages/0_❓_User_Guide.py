    After uploading your CSV, you will be prompted to **map your CSV columns** to the fields the application expects.
    This step is crucial for the dashboard to understand your data correctly.

    **How it Works:**
    * **Data Preview:** The mapping interface will show the first 5 rows of your uploaded CSV to help you identify your columns.
    * **Application Fields (Left):** On the left, you'll see a list of data fields the application needs (e.g., "{CONCEPTUAL_COLUMNS.get('date', 'Date/Time')}", "{CONCEPTUAL_COLUMNS.get('pnl', 'Profit/Loss')}"). Critical fields required for basic operation are marked with an asterisk (`*`).
    * **Your CSV Columns (Right):** For each application field, select the corresponding column header from *your* CSV file using the dropdown menu.
    * **Auto-Mapping Attempt:** The system will try to automatically suggest mappings based on common names and synonyms. Please review these suggestions carefully.
    * **Data Type Warnings (‚ö†Ô∏è):** If the system detects a potential mismatch between the data type of your selected CSV column and what the application expects for a field (e.g., you map a text column to a numeric PnL field), a warning icon (‚ö†Ô∏è) will appear. Please pay close attention to these warnings.
    * **Confirmation:** Once you've mapped all necessary columns (especially critical ones), click "Confirm Column Mapping" to proceed.

    **Key Application Fields (Conceptual Columns):**
    The application internally uses standardized names for data fields. You need to map your CSV columns to these concepts:

        st.markdown("*Fields marked with `*` are critical and must be mapped.*")

    **Tips for Successful Mapping:**
    * Ensure your CSV is well-formed.
    * Pay close attention to the data preview to correctly identify your columns.
    * Carefully review auto-mapped suggestions.
    * Address any data type mismatch warnings (‚ö†Ô∏è) by ensuring the correct CSV column is selected or by cleaning your source data if necessary.
    * If a conceptual field is not present in your CSV (and is not critical), you can leave it unmapped by selecting the blank option in the dropdown.

    st.subheader("1.3. Using Sidebar Filters")
    st.markdown("""
    Once data is successfully mapped and processed, you can use the filters in the sidebar to refine the dataset for analysis:
    * **Risk-Free Rate:** Set the annual risk-free rate.
    * **Date Range:** Select a specific period.
    * **Symbol Filter:** Filter by trading symbol (if mapped).
    * **Strategy Filter:** Filter by strategy name (if mapped).
    * **Benchmark Selection:** Choose a benchmark for comparison.
    * **Initial Capital:** Set initial capital for percentage return calculations.

    Changes to these filters will dynamically update the analyses.

        * **Critical Fields Error:** If you see "Critical fields not mapped," ensure you've selected a CSV column for all fields marked with `*` (e.g., Date, PnL).
        * **Duplicate Critical Mapping Error:** Each critical application field (like 'Date', 'PnL') must be mapped to a *unique* column from your CSV. You cannot map the same CSV column to two different critical fields.
