    - **Correlation is Not Causation:** A strong statistical relationship doesn't mean a feature causes good performance.
    - **Overfitting:** High risk with many features and complex models. What looks good in-sample might fail out-of-sample. Stress the need for robust validation (cross-validation, forward testing if possible â€“ though harder in a post-hoc journal analysis).
    - **Data Snooping/Lookahead Bias:** Testing many hypotheses on the same dataset increases the chance of finding spurious correlations. Ensure no information unavailable at the time of a hypothetical trade decision is used.
    - **Non-Stationarity:** Financial markets evolve. Relationships discovered may not hold in the future.
    - **Transaction Costs & Slippage:** Analyses are often based on gross P&L. Real-world net P&L can be significantly different.
    - **Economic Rationale:** Findings are more compelling if they align with some plausible economic or behavioral theory. Purely data-mined relationships are often fragile.
    - **Statistical Significance vs. Economic Significance:** A feature might be statistically significant but its impact on P&L so small it's not economically meaningful after costs.
    - **The Elusiveness of Alpha:** True, persistent alpha is rare and difficult to isolate. This section provides tools for exploration and hypothesis generation, not a guaranteed alpha discovery machine.
